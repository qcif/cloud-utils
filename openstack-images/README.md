Creating OpenStack images
=========================

The _q-image-maker.sh_ script simplifies the process of creating and
uploading an image to OpenStack.

It invokes the QEMU commands to create the image file, and to run a
virtual machine instance so the operating system can be installed onto
it. It also runs the OpenStack command to upload the image.
